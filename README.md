_(Diagram is highly recommended — e.g., from raw → staging → curated → dashboard)_  

1. **Ingestion**: Raw data pulled from APIs / S3 / Redshift.  
2. **Processing**: ETL jobs (Glue/Spark/SQL) clean & transform data.  
3. **Storage**: Curated tables in Redshift/Databricks/Andes.  
4. **Visualization**: Dashboards in QuickSight/Tableau.
